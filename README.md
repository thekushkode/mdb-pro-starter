Bark Ave is a dog daycare, boarding, & spa facility in the Smyrna/ Atlanta area. This facility was deeply affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. It went from having over 120 dogs per day + overnights to less than 15 dogs pe day almost overnight. They were due for a redesign, so through my freelancing business, Goat Web Design, I offered to create a new UI for themm, free of charge.
